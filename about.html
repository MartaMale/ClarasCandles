  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Clara’s Candles began as a passion project rooted in creativity, comfort,
    and the joy of making something by hand. Each candle is carefully poured
    in small batches using quality ingredients.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our mission is simple: create candles that make your home feel warm,
    calm, and inviting.
